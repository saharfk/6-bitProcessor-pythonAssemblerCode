# 6bitProcessorVHDL-pythonAssemblerCode

### all of the project is writen in the [PDF file](https://github.com/saharfk/6bitProcessorVHDL-pythonAssemblerCode/blob/main/CoDesign_992_Project_SaharFkhrieh.pdf)
1. implemented the processor using VHDL and checked its performance by executing the following code, which combines 5 and 3.
2. Implement the multiplication operation using the addition operation and software and show its operation's accuracy. Wrote an assembly code similar to the first part that performs the multiplication operation. Give.
